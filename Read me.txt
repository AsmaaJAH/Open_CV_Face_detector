Please make sure to follow the video instructions to avoid a global issue reported here:

That issue usually happens while convertting ML & AI projects that contains external dependencies, or data-bases , or packedgets
that are very popular and commonly used in Ml like "OpenCV"

We tried to use programs like :
1. PyInstaller
2. auto py to exe
3. cx_Freeze

and followed these links instructions:

And this solved the issue
So, we summurized the solution with steps in a recorded well-organized short videos for the speech and face-recognition projects
the program is working so fine in the terminal or in the pycharm or anaconda or any other python environment
and when converting it to ".exe" file, it will automatecally import & open any possible data files that it will need to run.


just download the desired project: "Face recognition " or "speech recogniition",
install the program, and double click on the .exe standalone file from your PC,
and it will immediately work precisely correct.

Thank You.
